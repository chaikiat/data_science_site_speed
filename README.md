# A Data Science Project - Classification Analysis of Website Speed and User Experience
Does the speed of loading a website impact whether a user bounces from the website? This is a data science project developed on a Python notebook, that trains the data on a few machine learning models. With the best performing model then used to make predictions, to challenge the hypothesis.

## Introduction
The site speed of a website is the speed in which a page on a website loads, and the site speed has been mentioned by various sources, including Google, to impact user experience and conversions on the website. This means that the faster a webpage loads, the more engaged a user will be and thus have more inclination to proceed to purchase something from the website. Bouncing is when an unengaged user leaves the website without viewing more than one page. In this case, would a slow website lead to a unengaged user who subsequently bounce to leave the website?

## Objective
The goal in this analysis is to analyse the site speed of the a webpage, userâ€™s device and whether the user bounces from the website. I intend to use features like the site speed of the user, user's device type, device brand, device mode, operating system, browser type and version - to predict whether a user will bounce from the website.
